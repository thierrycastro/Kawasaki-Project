## Project: Kawasaki

### Automated Test: Functionality Check of Registration, Login, Dealer Location, Motorcycle Menu, Search Box and Banner.

### Objective
Registration - The objective of this test is to verify whether the process of registering new users in the system works correctly, according to the defined requirements. This test case aims to ensure that all mandatory fields are completed appropriately, and that the system responds appropriately in normal and exceptional situations.

Login - The purpose of this test is to verify that the authentication system allows legitimate users to access their accounts securely and effectively, while preventing unauthorized access. Testing must ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements of the login process are met, from validating credentials to protecting against malicious access attempts.

Dealership Location - The purpose of this test is to ensure that the system correctly identifies, processes and uses the location of a specific entity(ies). This includes checking the accuracy of location data (such as entity name and zip code) and correct integration with APIs. 

Motorcycles Menu - The objective of this test is to ensure that the menu correctly displays the available promotions, allowing users to interact with it in an efficient and intuitive way.

Search Box - The objective of this test is to ensure that the system allows users to find information quickly, accurately and relevantly, according to the defined search criteria. This test must verify the efficiency of the search algorithm, the adequacy of the results returned, the usability of the search interface, and compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.

Banner - The purpose of this test is to ensure that sliding banners are displayed correctly in the user interface, providing a pleasant and interactive visual experience. This test must verify that the carousel works as planned, presenting the banners in sequence, allowing manual and automatic navigation, and meeting design, performance and accessibility requirements.
